== Description ==

This plugin is Wordpress shell for javascript [FloatBox](http://randomous.com/floatbox/home) library by [Byron McGregor](http://randomous.com/). Floatbox is a javascript library for displaying windowed content over top of web pages. It can be considered a "lightbox clone" (Lightview, Lightbox, Shadowbox, Fancybox, Thickbox, etc.) with great image gallery capabilities, but also extends that model with support for all types of content and strong programmability for "smart", interactive content. Floatbox is highly customizable, easy to deploy, and very robust and reliable across all modern browsers.
